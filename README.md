### Code Structure

Project code structure is organized and divided into various application folders and constructed using Django Rest Framework

#### Project Apps

- **profile app**: This app contains model, views, serializers, tests and urls for profile

## Agile design

### About

- Agile development is the most effective way to development of any website
- This was my second attempt in agile development but I feel I made a tremendous improvement
- I was able to follow the steps and add milestones in this project

### User Story Template

- Using Github issues first I created the template for a user story that was later used to create user stories. I created four labels: must have, could have, should have.

### Kanban Board

- As a visual representation of the project's status, showing what tasks are to be done, in progress and completed.Each task is represented as a card on the board, and the cards can be moved from one column to another to show progress.
